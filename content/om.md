About the website
=========================

This webpage is a part of a web programming course at Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola. The goal of this project is to create a stackoverflow copy and I chose to use the flower theme FlowerFlow.

We have learned the PHP framework ANAX and this project is supposed to use this framework and develop a stackoverflow copy website. Less is used to manage the website CSS styles.
