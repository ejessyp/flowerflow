<h1>About the website</h1>
<p>This website is a project of a web programming course Ramverk1 at Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola.
The goal of this project is to create a stackoverflow copy.
</p>
<p>I chose to use the flower theme FlowerFlow to create a stackoverflow copy website. Less is used
    to manage the website CSS styles.
